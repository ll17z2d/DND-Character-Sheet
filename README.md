# DND-Character-Sheet


A digital DnD Character Sheet Windows application made using WPF and adhering to the MVVM design pattern + includes unit tests. This is still acitvely being worked on when I get free time outside of uni and other commitments.


Current functionality includes: 

 -create new characters with extensive details (spells, notes, weapons etc.)
 
 -auto-generate skill modifiers 
 
 -load + edit previously saved characters 
 
 -slick (imo) design
 
 -and more!
